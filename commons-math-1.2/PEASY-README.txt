PeasyCam uses a tiny subset of the commons math project, to wit,
the geometry routines. Per the rights outlined in its
Apache License, I've "modified" commons math by throwing eveything
away that isn't the geometry routines.

In order to avoid conflicts with other instances of commons math in
a user's classpath, I've modified the packages.

The complete commons math library is available at
